The goal of SEQuential is to implement sequential trial emulation for the analysis of observational databases. The SEQuential software accommodates time-varying treatments and confounders, as well as binary and failure time outcomes. SEQ allows to compare both static and dynamic strategies, can be used to estimate observational analogs of intention-to-treat and per-protocol effects, and can adjust for potential selection bias induced by losses-to-follow-up.

## Installation

You can install the development version of SEQuential from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("CausalInference/SEQuential", subdir = "SEQuential")
```

## Setting up your Analysis

`SEQuential` uses R's S4 object class system to handle function input/output. From the user side, this amounts to calling a helpful constructor `SEQopts` and then feeding that into `SEQuential`. `SEQestimate` can also take the provided options and return a (very rough) estimated time for analysis.

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(SEQuential)
data <- SEQdata

model <- SEQuential(data, id.col = "ID", time.col = "time",
                    eligible.col = "eligible", treatment.col = "tx_init", 
                    outcome.col = "outcome", 
                    time_varying.cols = c("N", "L", "P"),
                    fixed.cols = "sex",
                    method = "ITT",
                    options = SEQopts(km.curves = TRUE))

outcome(model)       # Returns a list of all outcome models as S3 fastglm objects over the course of bootstrapping
diagnostics(model)   # Returns a table of unique and non-unique outcomes

# Plotting
km.curve(model)                      # Returns the Survival curve
km.data(model)                      # Returns a dataframe of survival data in long-format for other analysis/plotting
```

### Assumptions

This package places several assumptions onto the input data and unexpected results and errors may arise if these are not followed-

1.  User provided `time.col` begins at 0 per unique `id.col` entries, we also assume that the column contains only integers and continues by 1 for every time step. e.g. (0, 1, 2, 3, ...) is allowed and (0, 1, 2, 2.5, ...) or (0, 1, 2, 4, 5, ...) are not.
    -   Provided `time.col` entries may be out of order as a sort is enforced at the beginning of the function, e.g. (0, 2, 1, 4, 3, ...) is valid because it begins at 0 and is continuously increasing by increments of 1, even though it is not ordered.
2.  `eligible` and colnumn names provided to `excused.cols` are once one only one (with respect to `time.col`) flag variables

## Return

The primary function, `SEQuential`, returns an S4 object of class `SEQoutput` with slots:

1.  params - the SEQparams object created through the SEQuential process
2.  DT - Expanded data table with weighting information
3.  outcome - outcome covariates
4.  numerator - numerator covariates when weighting
5.  denominator - denominator covariates when weighting
6.  hazard - the hazard ratio
7.  survival.curve - ggplot survival curve
8.  survival.data - survival and risk data for all points of followup
9.  risk.difference - risk difference at end of followup with CIs if bootstrapped
10. risk.ratio - risk ratio at end of followup with CIs if bootstrapped
11. time - elapsed time for the SEQuential analysis

These can be handily and easily printed to the terminal with by calling the object as `model` (if continuing the example above). While this this the shape of the output object, not all slots will always be filled, e.g. if a user providers `hazard = TRUE`, then the survival curves, data, and associated risks will return `NA`.
