Description: Implemention of sequential trial emulation for the analysis of observational databases. 
    The SEQuential software accommodates time-varying treatments and confounders, as well as binary 
    and failure time outcomes. SEQ allows to compare both static and dynamic strategies, 
    can be used to estimate observational analogs of intention-to-treat 
    and per-protocol effects, and can adjust for potential selection bias induced by losses-to-follow-up.
    More information on specific analysis cases can be found on the SEQuential wiki <github.com/CausalInference/SEQuential/wiki>
