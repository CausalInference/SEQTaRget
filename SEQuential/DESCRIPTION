Description: A package to estimate the observational analogs of the intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocal effects
             of hypothetical treatment strategies. This package is an extention of  the Initiators SAS macro built by
             Roger Logan, Goodarz Danaei, and Miguel Hernan and is designed to analyze observational longitudinal data
             to estimate the effect of interventions sustained over time. The premise is to emulate the design and analysis
             of hypothetical random trials.
