Description: A package to estimate the observational analogs of the intention-to-treat and per-protocol effects of hypothetical treatment strategies. Created as an extension of the [INITIATORS SAS macro](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3613145/) built by Roger Logan, Goodarz Danaei, and Miguel Hernan, this tool is designed to analyze observational longitudinal data to estimate the effect of interventions sustained over time. The premise is to emulate the design and analysis of a hypothetical randomized trial. This software is capable of conducting the observational analogs of intention-to-treat, per-protocol, and as-treated analyses. All analyses are conducted using pooled logistic regression to approximate the hazard ratio from a proportional hazard Cox model.
